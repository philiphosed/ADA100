variableName : variableType := value

with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO; removes prefix for function name in procedure

Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line vs Put_Line

'Character'
"String"

local procedure is available to overall procedure it is written in, makes it 'private'


syntax for procedures:

   procedure <name> (param1Name : [in out] type, ...)

   in only parameter means it will stay the same

   out is change in value output

multiple parameters are seperated by semicolons not commas

ads(spec file), write out variable, procedures and overloading

adb(body file), implementation of the ads 

next lab will have simple sum

attribute `first and `last

Ada.Integer_text_IO

methods with no return are better for memory management

dividing integer by 10 will truncate any decimal place values
