variableName : variableType := value

with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO; removes prefix for function name in procedure

Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line vs Put_Line

'Character'
"String"

local procedure is available to overall procedure it is written in, makes it 'private'


syntax for procedures:

   procedure <name> (param1Name : [in out] type, ...)

   in only parameter means it will stay the same

   out is change in value output

multiple parameters are seperated by semicolons not commas

ads(spec file), write out variable, procedures and overloading

adb(body file), implementation of the ads 

next lab will have simple sum

attribute `first and `last

Ada.Integer_text_IO

methods with no return are better for memory management

dividing integer by 10 will truncate any decimal place values

Lab 4 review

String concatination using & and Integer`image attribute

types:

integer 
string
boolean
natural
Float

range for loop

  for Index in 1..5 loop
  end loop

dice_value := Integer range 1..6;

subtype:
type Dice_Valid_Values is range 1..6;
dice_value: Dice_Valid_Values;

setting dice_value := 0; raises exception

type conversion of same type range and values: dice_value := Dice_Valid_Values(Integer)

type Person_Age is range 0..150;
subtype Child_Age is Person_age range Person_age`First..17;
subtype Adult_Age is Person_age range Person_age 18..62;
subtype Senior_Age is Person_age range Person_age 63..Person_Age`Last;

Float
in general are unranged min or maximum

Cannot do arithmetic of floats with ints, must do conversion

Floating point arithmetic are weird and not truly accurate unless explicit

type Money is delta 0.01 digits 14; we care about the 14th decimal value for money type

quick rename: package Money_IO is new Ada.Text_IO.Decimal_IO(Money);

Strings and interesting behavior

declaring empty string cannot happen

strings are an array of character, allowed to give range of string for how many characters it needs

must use full size of string to it

enumerations: small set of values for a type

enum calling starts with 0

unbounded strings get over the limited nature of strings by not requiring range for strings. Unfortunatly they are very memory expensive.
